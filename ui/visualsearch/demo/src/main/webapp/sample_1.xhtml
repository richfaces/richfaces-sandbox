        Questions &amp; TODO:
        <li>
            Limit ajax request, the component is crazy with them!
        </li>
        <li>
            Should this component be value holder?
            Since it is also action source then when shall the value be updated, only on search?
        </li>
        <li>
            I think that server mode lacks sense with autocomplete.
        </li>
        <li>
            Should we pass only query to onsearch listener or also stringified queryJSON or maybe something else?
        </li>
        <li>
            It would be cool to not re-render anything during suggestion and only on search.
        </li>
        <li>
            Actually I think that there should be only javascript onsearch hook that someone could attach a4j:ajax to in stead of having one
            built-in ajax function for all 3 hooks (facetSuggestion, valueSuggestion, onsearch), what do you think?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Note that if we specify "render" attribute then it will be called on every hook, like facetSuggestion, valueSuggestion, onsearch.
            And I don't think anyone would like to refresh datatable with search results until the entire search query is ready.
            See the "Counter", how it increments on every request from visualsearch component.
        </li>
        <li>
            Should method bound to valueSuggestionListener accept ValueSuggestionEvent param (which makes bean dependant on RF, thus view layer)
            or should we pass string params. Problem with string params is that there can be many of them (searchTerm,facet,query,queryJSON).
        </li>
        <li>
            Right now valueSuggestions must return map of string facet name as key and list of string values for that facet.
            Maybe it would be cool to allow attaching converter for suggestions, thus allowing them to be list of objects.
            Or even better add extra tag like &lt;visualsearch:visualsearchValueSuggestion facet="#{obj.someName}" value="#{obj.someValue}"/>
            and visualsearch:visualsearchFacetSuggestion.
        </li>
